        <a> = defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
        href = specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
        rel = specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
        ./ = root folder or index.html
        ../ = go back one folder.
        target="_blank" = Opens the document in a new window or tab.
        target="_self" = Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked.
        title = specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
        <img> = Use the img element inside <a> to use an image as a link.
        mailto = Use mailto inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email).
        
        Tip:The main file of a folder will always be index.html, in case there is no such file you will see all the files.
