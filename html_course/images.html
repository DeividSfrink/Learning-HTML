    <!--Insert an image from a web site-->

    <img src="../img/cellphone.jpg" alt="Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.">

    <!-- 
        <img> = is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        src = Specifies the path to the image.
        alt = Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

        Tip: svg elements are vector resources that, no matter how large or small you make them, they will never lose their resolution and are widely used in modern web design.
             In addition, it weighs very little and that makes websites load faster.
